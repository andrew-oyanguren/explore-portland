This is a landing page with a travel website concept. This project showcases my skills using Bootstrap and Sass. I started with the creative process of wireframing, and turned that into a well thougt out digital design using Figma. 

With a mobile first approach, I was able to transform my final design into an elegant responsive website with cross broswer compatibility.
